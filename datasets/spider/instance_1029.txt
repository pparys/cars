Here is a database schema:
singer
* Singer_ID (number): singer id
* Name (text): name
* Birth_Year (number): birth year
* Net_Worth_Millions (number): net worth millions
* Citizenship (text): citizenship

song
* Song_ID (number): song id
* Title (text): title
* Singer_ID (number): singer id
* Sales (number): sales
* Highest_Position (number): highest position
Please write me a SQL statement that answers the following question:
What are the citizenships that are shared by singers with a birth year before 1945 and after 1955?
Remember, DO NOT provide any commentary or explanation of what the code does, just the SQL statement ending in a semicolon.
