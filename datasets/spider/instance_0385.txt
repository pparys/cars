Here is a database schema:
course

* Name (text): name
* Age (text): age
* Hometown (text): hometown

course_arrange

Please write me a SQL statement that answers the following question:
What are the age and hometown of teachers?
Remember, DO NOT provide any commentary or explanation of what the code does, just the SQL statement ending in a semicolon.
