Here is a database schema:
museum
* Museum_ID (number): museum id
* Name (text): name
* Num_of_Staff (number): num of staff
* Open_Year (text): open year

visitor
* ID (number): customer id
* Name (text): name
* Level_of_membership (number): level of membership
* Age (number): age

visit
* Museum_ID (number): museum id
* visitor_ID (text): customer id
* Num_of_Ticket (number): num of ticket
* Total_spent (number): total spent
Please write me a SQL statement that answers the following question:
find the names of museums which have more staff than the minimum staff number of all museums opened after 2010.
Remember, DO NOT provide any commentary or explanation of what the code does, just the SQL statement ending in a semicolon.
