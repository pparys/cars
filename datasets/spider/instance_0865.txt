Here is a database schema:
Highschooler
* ID (number): id
* name (text): name
* grade (number): grade

Friend
* student_id (number): student id
* friend_id (number): friend id

Likes
* student_id (number): student id
* liked_id (number): liked id
Please write me a SQL statement that answers the following question:
What are the names and grades for each high schooler?
Remember, DO NOT provide any commentary or explanation of what the code does, just the SQL statement ending in a semicolon.
