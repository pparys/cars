Here is a database schema:
course
* Course_ID (number): course id
* Staring_Date (text): staring date
* Course (text): course

teacher
* Teacher_ID (number): teacher id
* Name (text): name
* Age (text): age
* Hometown (text): hometown

course_arrange
* Course_ID (number): course id
* Teacher_ID (number): teacher id
* Grade (number): grade
Please write me a SQL statement that answers the following question:
What are the towns from which at least two teachers come from?
Remember, DO NOT provide any commentary or explanation of what the code does, just the SQL statement ending in a semicolon.
