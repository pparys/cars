Here is a database schema:
Highschooler
* ID (number): id
* name (text): name
* grade (number): grade

Friend
* student_id (number): student id
* friend_id (number): friend id

Likes
* student_id (number): student id
* liked_id (number): liked id
Please write me a SQL statement that answers the following question:
What are the ids of high school students who do not have friends?
Remember, DO NOT provide any commentary or explanation of what the code does, just the SQL statement ending in a semicolon.
