Here is a database schema:
AREA_CODE_STATE
* area_code (number): area code
* state (text): state

CONTESTANTS
* contestant_number (number): contestant number
* contestant_name (text): contestant name

VOTES
* vote_id (number): vote id
* phone_number (number): phone number
* state (text): state
* contestant_number (number): contestant number
* created (time): created
Please write me a SQL statement that answers the following question:
List the area codes in which voters voted both for the contestant 'Tabatha Gehling' and the contestant 'Kelly Clauss'.
Remember, DO NOT provide any commentary or explanation of what the code does, just the SQL statement ending in a semicolon.
